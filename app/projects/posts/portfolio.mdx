## Introduction

This website is my personal space to present ideas, experiments, and projects I work on over time. It’s intentionally simple, fast, and content-focused, letting the work speak for itself.



## What you’ll find here

- Project write-ups and experiments  
- Technical blog posts  
- Notes about things I’m currently learning  

## Portfolio Tech stack
- React + Next.js (SSR)
- Tailwind for styling
- [next-mdx-remote-client](https://github.com/ipikuka/next-mdx-remote-client) with customization for mdx rendering
