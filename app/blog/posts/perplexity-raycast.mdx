## VALID UNTIL December 9, 2025 !
(or longer? until perplexity offers ends)

## Introduciton
Recently, Google released a 12-month free Gemini Pro plan for students — and shortly after, Perplexity followed with something similar: Perplexity PRO for students.
The best part? Unlike Gemini, this one includes $5/month in Perplexity API credits, giving you enough room to build, tinker, and integrate AI wherever you want.
<br/>In this post I’ll show you how to plug Perplexity into Raycast Ask AI completely free, plus the config I use and the approximate cost per request.
## 1. Get Your API Key
Search for Perplexity Student Program and register through SheerID using your university email.
Once approved, you’ll get Perplexity PRO automatically — make sure to cancel the subscription immediately so it won’t renew later. You’ll still keep the year-long access.
Then head to the [Perplexity API key page](https://www.perplexity.ai/account/api/keys) and generate a key.
(Do not share it — treat it like a password.)

## 2. Activate Raycast custom providers
Open Raycast → Settings → AI → enable Custom Providers.
Scroll slightly up afterward and click Reveal Providers Config.

Rename the template file to: : `providers.yaml`

## 3. Creating our model provider
Now we’ll connect the Perplexity API to Raycast.
Below is the configuration I use — it keeps responses fast and the cost extremely low (≈ $0.0057 per request → ~900 requests per month with the free credit).

You’re free to tweak it based on your needs.
The most important cost-related fields are: <br/>
`max_tokens` : Maximum output length → Lower = cheaper. <br/>
`context` : Token window / memory → Lower = cheaper. <br/>
`search_context_size` : Depth of web lookup → **Biggest impact** on cost


```
providers:
  - id: Perplexity
    name: PerplexityAPI
    base_url: https://api.perplexity.ai
    api_keys:
      perplexity: # Your API key

    # Parameters to keep costs low and answers quick
    additional_parameters:
      return_images: false
      max_tokens: 1024
      temperature: 0.2
      # This block explicitly enables the search API for each call.
      web_search_options:
        enabled: true
        search_context_size: low 

    models:
      - id: sonar
        name: Sonar (Budget Web)
        provider: perplexity
        description: Perplexity's fast, cost-effective model with real-time web access.
        context: 8192 # Keep context low to save on input token costs
        
        abilities:
          temperature:
            supported: true
          vision:
            supported: false
          system_message:
            supported: true
          tools:
            supported: false
          reasoning_effort:
            supported: false
```
## 4. Using the provider
Once the provider file is saved correctly:
1. Open Raycast → Settings → AI
2. Under Quick AI Model, select Sonar (Budget Web) (or whatever name you set)
3. Start chatting — you’re now running Perplexity inside Raycast for free

## And you’re done 🎉

You now have a fully working Raycast AI setup powered by Perplexity — no local LLMs, no monthly cost, just free API credits fueling daily usage.

If Raycast fails to detect the config, double-check indentation (YAML is strict), ensure the file is named providers.yaml, and verify your API key is correct.

Happy building — and enjoy your free year of AI. 🚀
