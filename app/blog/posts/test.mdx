publishedAt: '2025-12-18'
summary: 'A quick overview of the new blog system: richer code blocks, tables, and full LaTeX support.'
---

## Introduction

The blog system has been upgraded to make technical posts cleaner, clearer, and more enjoyable to read.  
It supports **better code blocks**, **native tables**, and **full LaTeX support** — all rendered directly from MDX.
Possible thanks to [next-mdx-remote-client](https://github.com/ipikuka/next-mdx-remote-client#readme), with plugins
of [rehype plugins](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) alongside some customization.



## Tables Support

| Item                | Category        | Value | Rating |
|---------------------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| **Clockwork Owl**   | Gadgets         | 73    | ★★★★☆ |
| Lunar Tea Leaves    | Consumables     | 18    | ★★★☆☆ |
| Neon Paper Clips    | Office Stuff    | 42    | ★★★★★ |
| Pocket Sundial      | Curiosities     | 55    | ★★★☆☆ |
| Floating Bookmark   | Miscellaneous  | 29    | ★★★★☆ |



## Code blocks (with line numbers & highlights)

```js showLineNumbers {2,5}
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;

  let a = 0, b = 1;
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    [a, b] = [b, a + b];
  }

  return b;
}
```
## Math & LaTeX
Inline math works naturally, for example:
$a = b + c$

Standalone equations:
$$
\begin{align*}
F(0) &= 0 \\
F(1) &= 1 \\
F(2) &= F(n-1) + F(n-2) \; , \; n\ge 2

\end{align*}
$$
This makes it easy to write about algorithms, math, or anything slightly more formal without hacks.
