This is the fourth and last part of the guide and after this section we will have a fully working simulation.

- (except for user friendly UI/UX which is up to you to bring)

We will use a rather simple algorithm for detection of the missiles, and using the existing curve we created in the last section, it will make our life a lot easier.

As you’ll see it’s not the most efficient algorithm as it’s polynomial in theory but linear in practice.

<br/>

### The Algorithm idea

we have every interceptor location at a given time using the state manager, we will need to set a “detection radius” to the interceptors (in my case it’s unified value),  we also have every missile path (curve).

Every missile has 2 options of “fate” - being intercepted or landing on earth.

Because the missile path is deterministic we will use Predictive Sampling approach.

We will declare -  t in [0,1] representing the position of the missile t * 100 percent of the path - which we have access to with `curve.getPoint(t, currentPoint);` 

so let’s take 100 samples , so we will check the position at 1%,2%,… of the path.

then, for each sample - we will iterate over all the interceptors and check :

if dist(p,i) ≤R then we found an interception match !

- ’p’ representing our point and ‘i’ represents the interceptor while ‘R’ is it’s detection radius

we return “no match” if we iterate over all the samples for all interceptors and find nothing.

Now, because we check in ascending samples order - the first match is guaranteed to be the first interceptor the missile travels through it’s detection radius.

The time complexity is O(n⋅m), where n is the number of samples and m is the number of interceptors. Since both n (≈100) and m (typically < 50) are small, the algorithm behaves effectively **linearly in practice**. 

We run this algorithm **once** per each missile at creation (or launch) and determine it’s fate.

You can see the full implementation [here](https://github.com/iLiranS/Laser-Defense-Simulation/blob/main/src/objects/missile/utils/calculateMissileFate.ts "https://github.com/iLiranS/Laser-Defense-Simulation/blob/main/src/objects/missile/utils/calculateMissileFate.ts")

<br/>

### How to use it

we only need to calculate the fate once, and we need the curve for it - so the best place would be using `useEffect` in `ArcLine`component - the algorithm requires : `(curve, interceptors, samples, detectionRadius)` which we are going to get through props from Missile component.

### That’s it 🥳

I never wrote a guide before so I hope you managed to understand and implemented similar results or your desired ones.

Some little extra tips : combine radius helper (with InstancedMesh) ,random locations and some post processing and we will get this result :
