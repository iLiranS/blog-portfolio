## Archived Projects
- [Vote-Arena](https://github.com/iLiranS/Vote-Arena) – A fun online polling platform. This was a fairly large project that included creating polls in different styles (tier lists, tournaments, etc.) with nice visuals, detailed stats for each poll, and popularity metrics.  
- Finance Web App – Features graphs, weekly/monthly/yearly stats, and more.  
- Portfolios – I had many older portfolios, but I decided to keep the simplest one 😅  
- [AnimeEcom](https://github.com/iLiranS/AnimeEcom) – A dummy e-commerce app.  
- Word-Frenzy-Game – A fully working web app game similar to Gartic Phone, with live chat, game stages, and more. Unfortunately, due to security issues and lack of maintenance, I had to shut it down.
