## Overview

The **Laser Defense System** is a simulation project that explores the idea of using directed-energy weapons to intercept and neutralize incoming threats.
I've created a complete runthrough blog posts of the project. <br/>
except for the real physics based trajectory which I will add later on so I've used a simple trajectory in the blog.



## The idea
Aiming to simulate real missile trajectory and also to visualizes how a laser unit could:
- Detect incoming targets
- Track their trajectory
- Allocate energy to intercept them before impact

### Tech Stack
Three.JS + React (using R3F and Drei in Vite) , Tailwind , Zustand

## Simulation
