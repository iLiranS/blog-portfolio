summary: 'A short overview of my personal portfolio website and its MDX-powered content system.'

## Introduction

This website is my personal space to present ideas, experiments, and projects I work on over time.  
It’s intentionally simple, fast, and content-focused, letting the work speak for itself.



## What you’ll find here

- Project write-ups and experiments  
- Technical blog posts  
- Notes about things I’m currently learning  

Navigation is driven by headings and an automatic table of contents, making longer posts easy to scan.



## MDX in action

| Content Type | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| Headings     | Sections like this one |
| Links        | [Visit the homepage](/) |
| Images       | Inline visuals inside posts |
| Code         | Syntax-highlighted blocks |
| Tables       | Structured data like this |
| Math         | Inline $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ |



## Code example

```ts showLineNumbers
export function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## Math support
Inline math feels natural, like $f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)$,
and standalone equations stay readable:
$$ 
S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$
This setup makes it easy to document ideas clearly — whether that’s code, math, or just thoughts worth writing down.
